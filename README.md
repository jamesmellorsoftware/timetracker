# TIMETRACKER

## General info
Timetracker is a small application to track the amount of time spent on tasks throughout the day.\
It allows you to create new task timers, stop them, restart them, and delete them.\
It shows you the amount of time you spent on each task, as well as the total time you spent working that day.\
You can also scroll through different dates to see the amount of time worked on that day and the amount of time spent on each individual task.

## Technologies
* PHP version 7+ object oriented
* MySQL database
* jQuery
* SCSS / Sass -> CSS

## Setup
Download or pull the code, import timetracker.sql database to your MySQL installation.\
If you wish to edit the database credentials, they can be found as constants in admin/config.php and edited in there.\
Use the register page to create a user, which will send you to the Timetracker app.\
If you log out, your timers will be automatically saved in the state they are in.\
You will be able to log back in with the same credentials you used before.
